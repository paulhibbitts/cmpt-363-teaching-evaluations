# CMPT-363 Teaching Evaluations

These are the student evaluations for the last three terms of online CMPT-363 I taught at Simon Fraser University (Fall 2021 - Summer 2022).

The accompanying course hub for all three terms is available at https://paulhibbitts.github.io/cmpt-363, and the Canvas course for Summer 2022 is also still available at https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/69678. With thanks and appreciation to all of my past Simon Fraser University students, and to Parsa Rajabi for the idea of making these available in a GitHub repository.
